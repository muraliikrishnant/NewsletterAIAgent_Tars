We saw a <strong>23% reduction in downtime</strong> just by automating the diagnostic loop. Every minute of downtime costs $450 in lost revenue. We view waste not as a byproduct, but as an enemy.\n\n<img src=\"https://example.com/efficiency_chart.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Efficiency Chart\">\n\nTo optimize uptime, you need a ruthless protocol: 1) Diagnose remotely (saving 2.5 hours/ticket), 2) Deploy mobile service adjacent to the asset, 3) Automate the repair path. Data drives the decision. Speed executes it.</p>"
