I was working 14 hours a day but only producing 2 hours of value.\n\n<img src=\"https://example.com/focus_graph.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Focus vs Output\">\n\nBeing ruthless with attention is a strategy, not a punishment. Here’s the 3-step playbook that saved me 20 hours/week: 1) Cull inputs, 2) Block single-task time (4 hour blocks), 3) Ship something weekly.\n</p>"

The market is always right; your ego is usually wrong.\n\nHere is the autopsy of a failure: 1) I ignored the data (CAC was up 40%), 2) I trusted the wrong person, 3) I moved too fast. Failure isn't the opposite of success; it's part of the tuition.</p>"

      "output": "<h2>Stop Selling, Start Solving</h2>\n<p>Most people fail at sales because they are begging, not offering. If you have a cure for cancer, you don't beg people to take it. You give it to them. Your close rate should be >30% if the offer is right.\n\nValue is the only leverage you have. If they aren't buying, your value equation is broken (Value = (Dream Outcome x Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Effort)). Fix the offer, not the pitch.</p>"

The difference wasn't skill; it was hunger.\n\n<img src=\"https://example.com/team_culture.jpg\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Team Culture\">\n\nA-players don't need to be managed; they need to be unleashed. Look for: 1) High agency, 2) Obsessive curiosity, 3) Radical ownership.</p>"

If you want to build something massive, you have to be obsessed.\n\nObsession isn't unhealthy; it's necessary. 1) Pick your sacrifice, 2) Go all in (100 hours/week if needed), 3) Don't apologize for your ambition.</p>"

It's that simple.\n\nStop competing on price. Compete on value. If they complain about the price, they aren't your customer. They're a distraction.</p>"
